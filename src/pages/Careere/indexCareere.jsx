            <p className="txt2">Having appeared in the Lakers in a duet with the famous Shaquille O'Neal, he won three<br/> consecutive NBA champion titles (2000, 2001, 2002). After that, a feud began between them,<br/> which ended with the exchange of Shaq to the Miami Heat after the 2004 NBA Finals.<br/><br/>
After his departure, Bryant became the main star of the Lakers and the undisputed leader and<br/> symbol of the team. Kobe began to break all possible performance records — so, in the<br/> 2005/06 and 2006/07 seasons, he was recognized as the best sniper of the regular season.<br/><br/>
In 2006, he scored 81 points in a game with the Toronto Raptors, setting the second record for<br/> points scored in one game, after Wilt Chamberlain's one-point match in 1962.<br/><br/> 
In 2008, he was named the most valuable player of the NBA. The Lakers, led by Bryant, lost the<br/> 2008 NBA Finals, but in the 2008/09 and 2009/10 seasons, Kobe led the Lakers to an NBA<br/> victory twice more. Kobe was named the most valuable player of both finals. </p>

                <p className="txt3">At the age of 34 years 104 days, Bryant became the youngest player in the history of<br/> the league to break the 30,000 point milestone. He also became the most productive<br/> Lakers player in history.<br/><br/>
On November 29, 2015, he announced that this was the last season of his career<br/><br/>
In the game against the Utah Jazz — his last official NBA match — Bryant scored 60<br/> points, becoming the oldest player to whom this mark was submitted. Kobe also<br/> became the first in the history of the league to score so many points in a farewell<br/> match.</p>
