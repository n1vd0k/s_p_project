                Kobe Bryant's Workout Routine:<br/>
Kobe has a crazy training method that is very intense. During the off-season, Kobe<br/> mainly focuses on training in order to increase strength and endurance. As the season<br/> approaches, he begins to increase the conditional aspect of training.<br/> He trains six days a week, because he believes that the muscles need to be<br/> given a day to rest and recover. He usually performs the exercise for 8-12<br/> repetitions, which is the best method to achieve muscle hypertrophy<br/> 
Kobe uses acupuncture techniques to prevent injury.<br/>
According to Michael Jordan, Kobe is the only basketball player who can compare with him.</p>
